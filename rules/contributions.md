# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to NLP Builder! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our project. Please review the following guidelines before you start:

1. **Main Branch Protection**:

   - No code should be committed directly to the main branch.
   - Any pull request made to the main branch will be denied.

2. **Development Workflow**:

   - We have a branch named `Dev` which is identical to the main branch.
   - All new branches should be created from the `Dev` branch.
   - All pull requests should be made to the `Dev` branch.
   - Once the code is tested and approved, it will be merged into the `Dev` branch, and subsequently into the main branch.

3. **Feature-Specific Repositories**:
   - Each feature or step will have a separate repository.
   - Work should be completed and documented within these specific repositories before being integrated into the main project.

By following these guidelines, you help us maintain a stable and organized codebase. Thank you for contributing to NLP Builder!
